## Natural Numbers
- $\mathbb{N}$
- Whole numbers
	- Ones we use when counting
- Does not include zero
- Does not include negatives
- $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \dots \}$

## Integers
- $\mathbb{Z}$
- Whole numbers
- Includes zero
- Includes negatives
- $\mathbb{Z}_+$ = Positive Integers
- $\mathbb{Z}_-$ = Negative Integers
- $\{-3, -2, -1, 0,1,2,3,4,5, \dots \}$

## Real Numbers
- $\mathbb{R}$ 
- Whole numbers and decimals/fractions
- Includes zero
- Non-imaginary
- All decimals as long as they are precise/do not repeat
- $\{\frac{1}{2}, 6, -973, -\frac{6}{10}, \dots \}$

## Irrational Numbers
- $\mathbb{Q}$
- Non-terminating/repeating decimals
	- Cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers
- Non-imaginary/real numbers
- Does not include zero
