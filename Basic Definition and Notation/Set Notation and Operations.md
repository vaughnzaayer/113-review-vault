## Sets
- An unordered collection of objects

### Notation
- Consider: $$A = \{1,2,3\}$$
	- Read as "A *is the set containing the elements* 1, 2, and 3"

- $\in$ = "in"
	- $a \in \{a,b,c\}$

- $\notin$ = "not in"
	- $d \notin \{a,b,c\}$

- $\emptyset$ = Empty set
	- $A = \{\} = \emptyset$

- $:$ = "such that"
	- $A = \{x \in \mathbb{N} : x$ is even$\}$
	- "A is the set of all elements in the set of [[Special Sets#Natural Numbers|Natural Numbers]] *such that* x is even"

- $\mathcal{U}$ = Universe set
	- The set of all elements

- $\mathcal{P}(A)$ = Power set (of $A$, in this case)
	- Power set of $A$ is the set of all subsets of $A$



### Operations
- $\subseteq$ = "is a subset of"
	- $A \subset B$ 
	- "$A$ *is a subset of* $B$"
	- Every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$

- $\subset$ = "is a proper subset of"
	- $A \subset B$
	- "A *is a proper subset of* B"
	- Every element of $A$ is also in $B$, but $A \neq B$

- $\cap$ = Intersection
	- $A \cap B$
	- The set containing all elements that exist in both $A$ and $B$

- $\cup$ = Union
	- $A \cup B$
	- The set containing all elements that exist in either/both $A$ and $B$

- $\times$ = Cartesian Product
	- $A \times B$ 
	- The set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ with $a \in A$ and $b \in B$
		- $\{1, 2\} \times \{3,4\} = \{(1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4)\}$

- $\setminus$ = Set Minus/Set Difference
	- $A \setminus B$
	- The set containing all elements of $A$ which are also *not* elements of $B$

- $||$ = Cardinality
	- $|A|$
	- The cardinality or size of set $A$
		- Size = number of elements in the set
